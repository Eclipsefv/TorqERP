# TorqERP
TorqERP is my final project to graduate, it's meant to be a fairly lightweight yet complete ERP oriented to the automobile industry

For the backend I've decided to use Node.js/express because it's the technology I'm most familiarized with I believe it's fairly simple to get the bare minimum done (JWT's for security, bcrypt for passwords).

For the frontend I'm going to use .NET MAUI, I'm very used to C#/.NET as a whole and I'm using Razor for the UI because it allows me to have web components for styling the pages.

I will use PostgreSQL for the database, it's a very solid relational system and for an ERP it is integral to have a relational system.
